            <p>As a full-stack web developer, I utilize front-end technology such as HTML, JavaScript, React, Handlebars,
                Bootstrap and jQuery to create exciting, immersive digital destinations that have a lasting impact on visitors. To
                add functionality to these applications, utilize technology such as Node, Express, MySQL, MongoDB and GraphQL to
                build the back-end of an application.

                Additional to my experiences as a full-stack web developer, I have project management skills and managed financial
                reporting for both multiple billion-dollar corporations as well as a consulting firms.
